## Lazy Minting Contract

Minting an NFT on a blockchain mainnet generally costs some amount of money, since writing data onto the blockchain requires a fee (often called gas) to pay for the computation and storage. This can be a barrier for NFT creators, especially those new to NFTs who may not want to invest a lot of money up front before knowing whether their work will sell.

Using a few advanced techniques, it's possible to defer the cost of minting an NFT until the moment it's sold to its first buyer. The gas fees for minting are rolled into the same transaction that assigns the NFT to the buyer, so the NFT creator never has to pay to mint. Instead, a portion of the purchase price simply goes to cover the additional gas needed to create the initial NFT record.

Minting "just in time" at the moment of purchase is often called lazy minting, and it has been adopted by marketplaces like OpenSea (opens new window)to lower the barrier to entry for NFT creators by making it possible to create NFTs without any up-front costs.
